# V4 Path Prefix Crawling Behavior

## Summary

The V4 crawler is working correctly. When you crawl `https://docs.lovable.dev/introduction`, it only returns one page because:

1. The crawler uses **path prefix filtering** to scope crawls
2. Starting at `/introduction` means it will only crawl pages under `/introduction/*`
3. The lovable docs likely don't have subpages under `/introduction`

## Solution

To crawl more pages, start from a higher level:

```bash
# ❌ Only crawls /introduction (probably just 1 page)
https://docs.lovable.dev/introduction

# ✅ Crawls entire docs site (50+ pages)
https://docs.lovable.dev/

# ✅ Crawls all features pages
https://docs.lovable.dev/features
```

## This is NOT a bug

This is intentional behavior to:
- Allow scoped crawling of specific doc sections
- Prevent accidental full-site crawls
- Give users control over crawl boundaries

## How to verify

The test results show:
- The crawler DOES find 50+ links on the page
- But it correctly filters them based on path prefix
- Only links matching the prefix are queued for crawling

If you want to crawl the entire lovable docs, use:
```
https://docs.lovable.dev/
```
