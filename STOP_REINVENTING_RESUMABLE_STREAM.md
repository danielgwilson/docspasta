# 🚨 STOP REINVENTING RESUMABLE-STREAM! 🚨

**THIS IS THE 4TH TIME WE'VE REGRESSED FROM THE CORRECT SOLUTION**

## THE ONLY TRUTH THAT MATTERS

**RESUMABLE-STREAM IS LITERALLY DESIGNED BY VERCEL FOR EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING**

- ✅ It handles SSE protocol correctly
- ✅ It manages Last-Event-ID headers automatically
- ✅ It provides proper reconnection logic
- ✅ It's battle-tested in production
- ✅ It's MADE FOR SERVERLESS

## WHAT NOT TO DO (STOP DOING THIS!)

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Custom implementation
const stream = new ReadableStream({
  async start(controller) {
    // Some custom bullshit with try-catch
    controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(...))
  }
})

// ❌ WRONG - Query params for resumption
?lastEventId=123456

// ❌ WRONG - Storing events in localStorage
localStorage.setItem('events', JSON.stringify(allEvents))

// ❌ WRONG - Using timestamps as IDs
id: Date.now().toString()
```

## THE ONLY CORRECT WAY

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Use resumable-stream
import { createResumableStreamContext } from 'resumable-stream'
import { waitUntil } from '@vercel/functions'

const streamContext = createResumableStreamContext({
  redis: { publisher, subscriber },
  waitUntil // CRITICAL: Required for Node.js runtime!
})

// ✅ CORRECT - Let it handle everything
return streamContext.stream(request, async (send) => {
  // Just send events, the library handles EVERYTHING else
  await send('batch_completed', { completed: 10 })
})
```

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Always include `waitUntil` from '@vercel/functions' or you'll get `ctx.waitUntil is not a function` error!

## WHY WE KEEP FORGETTING

1. **V3 uses it correctly** - But we created V4 without looking at V3
2. **Custom seems simpler** - It's NOT. It's missing 90% of edge cases
3. **We think we're special** - We're not. Use the damn library.

## THE RULES (NEVER BREAK THESE)

1. **ALWAYS use resumable-stream for SSE endpoints**
2. **NEVER implement custom ReadableStream for SSE**
3. **NEVER use query params for Last-Event-ID**
4. **NEVER store full event history client-side**
5. **ALWAYS check V3 implementation first**

## Pattern to Copy

```typescript
// This is from V3 - COPY THIS PATTERN
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const { streamClient, publisherClient } = await createConnectedRedisClients()
  
  const streamContext = createResumableStreamContext({
    redis: { 
      publisher: publisherClient, 
      subscriber: streamClient 
    }
  })
  
  return streamContext.stream(request, async (send) => {
    // Your logic here
    await send('event_type', data)
  })
}
```

## If You're Reading This

**STOP** what you're doing and ask yourself:
- Am I about to implement SSE without resumable-stream?
- Am I creating a custom ReadableStream?
- Am I handling Last-Event-ID manually?

If yes to ANY of these: **STOP AND USE RESUMABLE-STREAM**

---

**Remember**: Every time we don't use resumable-stream, we're literally throwing away a perfect solution that Vercel built for us. It's like reinventing React every time we need a component.
