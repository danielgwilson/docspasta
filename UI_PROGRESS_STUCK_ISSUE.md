# UI Progress Stuck Issue - Docspasta V4

## CRITICAL: CRAWLING IS WORKING - THIS IS A UI-ONLY ISSUE

The crawler backend is functioning correctly. The issue is that the UI is not receiving or processing progress updates properly.

## Current Problem

1. **Jobs persist on refresh** ✅ (localStorage working)
2. **State restoration works** ✅ (fetches from DB on mount)
3. **SSE connection established** ✅ (EventSource connects)
4. **Progress stuck at 0** ❌ (UI not updating with SSE events)

## What We've Fixed So Far

1. **SSE Event Storage**: Added missing `user_id` field to `storeSSEEvent`
2. **Auth Mismatch**: Fixed state endpoints to use same auth (`getCurrentUser`) as job creation
3. **Field Names**: Fixed CrawlCard to use `totalProcessed`/`totalDiscovered` (not `processedCount`)
4. **Removed Broken resumeAt**: Was passing string event ID instead of character count

## Architecture Reminder

```
User → Create Job → DB Record → SSE Stream → UI Updates
                       ↓
                  Orchestrator → Crawler → Processor
                       ↓
                  SSE Events → DB Storage
```

## Key Files

- `/src/components/CrawlCard.tsx` - UI component that displays progress
- `/src/app/api/v4/jobs/[id]/stream/route.ts` - SSE streaming endpoint
- `/src/app/api/v4/jobs/[id]/state/route.ts` - State restoration endpoint
- `/src/lib/serverless/db-operations-simple.ts` - DB operations including `storeSSEEvent`

## Most Likely Causes

1. **SSE Event Format Mismatch**: The server might be sending events in a different format than the UI expects
2. **Event Listeners Not Firing**: The EventSource event listeners might not be receiving events
3. **Zod Parsing Rejecting Events**: The parseSSEEvent function might be silently failing

## Debug Steps

1. Check browser console for:
   - "✅ SSE connection opened" message
   - Any "Failed to parse" errors
   - Event listener console.log outputs

2. Check server logs for:
   - SSE events being sent
   - storeSSEEvent being called

3. Verify in browser DevTools Network tab:
   - SSE stream is connected
   - Events are being received

## Next Actions

1. Add more console.log debugging to see which events are received
2. Check if parseSSEEvent is rejecting valid events
3. Verify event type names match between server and client
4. Check if the event listeners are properly registered

## DO NOT CHANGE

- Crawler logic (it's working!)
- Database operations (they're working!)
- Three-function architecture
- Resumable-stream pattern

## Focus Area

The issue is specifically in how the CrawlCard component receives and processes SSE events. The backend is sending events correctly, but the UI is not updating.
