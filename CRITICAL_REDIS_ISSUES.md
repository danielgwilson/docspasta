# Critical Redis Connection Issues in V4 ✅ FIXED

## Problem Summary

The V4 serverless architecture had critical Redis connection management issues that have now been fixed:

1. **Singleton Pattern Anti-Pattern**: Was using singleton Redis clients in serverless functions leading to connection leaks
2. **No Connection Cleanup**: Redis connections were not being properly closed after use
3. **Memory Leaks**: Connections persisted across function invocations, causing memory issues
4. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: Eventually ran out of available Redis connections

## Files That Were Fixed

### 1. `/lib/serverless/streaming.ts` ✅ FIXED
- ~~Uses singleton Redis client pattern~~ → Now uses `withRedis` pattern
- ~~No connection cleanup~~ → All functions now properly cleanup
- ~~Connections persist across invocations~~ → Fresh connections per invocation

### 2. `/lib/serverless/redis-stream.ts` ✅ FIXED
- ~~Singleton Upstash client~~ → Creates fresh client per operation
- Now uses HTTP-based Upstash client (stateless)

### 3. `/lib/serverless/redis-queue.ts` ✅ FIXED
- ~~`createRedisClient()` creates connections but doesn't manage lifecycle~~ → Now uses `withRedis` pattern
- All queue operations now properly close connections
- Added `withRedisFallback` for non-critical operations

### 4. `/app/api/v4/worker/route.ts` ✅ FIXED
- ~~Creates Redis connection but only disconnects in error cases~~ → Removed direct Redis usage
- Now uses the new queue functions that handle connections internally

### 5. `/app/api/v4/jobs/route.ts` ✅ FIXED
- ~~Creates Redis connection for initial job setup~~ → Uses new `addUrlsToRedisQueue` function
- No more direct Redis client management

### 6. `/app/api/v4/jobs/[id]/stream/route.ts` ✅ FIXED
- ~~No cleanup when stream ends naturally~~ → Added comprehensive cleanup
- Added cleanup on request abort
- Uses `waitUntil` to ensure cleanup after stream consumption
- Proper error handling with cleanup in all paths

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Redis Connection Utility (`/lib/serverless/redis-connection.ts`)
```typescript
// Always use connections in try/finally blocks
await withRedis(async (client) => {
  // Use Redis client here
  await client.set('key', 'value')
}) // Connection automatically closed

// With fallback for non-critical operations  
await withRedisFallback(async (client) => {
  // Operation that can fail gracefully
}, defaultValue)

// With retry for connection failures
await withRedisRetry(async (client) => {
  // Critical operation with retry
})
```

### 2. Updated All Redis Usage
- ✅ Removed ALL singleton patterns
- ✅ All Redis operations now use `withRedis` or `withRedisFallback`
- ✅ Connections are guaranteed to close via try/finally blocks
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging with prefixes
- ✅ Upstash Redis uses stateless HTTP client (no connection management needed)

## Best Practices for Serverless Redis (Now Enforced)

1. **Never use singleton connections** - Create fresh connection per invocation ✅
2. **Always use try/finally** - Ensure cleanup even on errors ✅
3. **Short-lived connections** - Connect, do work, disconnect immediately ✅
4. **Graceful degradation** - Use fallbacks for non-critical operations ✅
5. **Connection timeouts** - Set reasonable timeouts (5s default) ✅
6. **No reconnection** - Disable auto-reconnect in serverless ✅
7. **Log lifecycle** - Track connection create/destroy for debugging ✅

## Testing Connection Leaks

```bash
# Monitor Redis connections (should stay low)
redis-cli CLIENT LIST | wc -l

# Watch for growing connection count (should be stable)
watch -n 1 'redis-cli CLIENT LIST | wc -l'

# Check for old connections
redis-cli CLIENT LIST | grep age
```

## Monitoring in Production

1. Set up alerts for connection count > 50
2. Monitor Redis memory usage trends
3. Track "Redis connected/disconnected" log patterns
4. Alert on "Failed to disconnect Redis" errors
5. Use APM to trace connection lifecycle

## Verification Checklist

- [x] No more singleton Redis clients in codebase
- [x] All Redis operations wrapped in withRedis/withRedisFallback
- [x] SSE streaming properly cleans up connections
- [x] Worker routes don't leak connections
- [x] Upstash uses stateless HTTP client
- [x] Connection logs show proper lifecycle
- [x] No Redis connections persist after function execution
