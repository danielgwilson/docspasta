# STOP MAKING IT COMPLICATED! 

## THE THREE FUNCTIONS ARE:

### 1. `/api/v4/jobs` - CREATE JOB
```typescript
// ONLY DOES THIS:
- Create job in database
- Add initial URL to database queue
- Return job ID
- THAT'S IT!
```

### 2. `/api/v4/crawl` - CRAWL URLS
```typescript
// ONLY DOES THIS:
- Receive URLs to crawl
- Crawl them
- Return content
- THAT'S IT!
```

### 3. `/api/v4/process` - PROCESS CONTENT
```typescript
// ONLY DOES THIS:
- Receive crawled content
- Process it
- Update job state
- Store results
- THAT'S IT!
```

## THE STREAM READS FROM DATABASE

The `/api/v4/jobs/[id]/stream` endpoint:
- Reads SSE events from the database
- Uses resumable-stream
- NO ORCHESTRATION
- NO WORKERS
- JUST READS AND STREAMS

## STOP ADDING COMPLEXITY

- NO REDIS QUEUES
- NO WORKER ENDPOINTS
- NO SELF-INVOKING FUNCTIONS
- NO ORCHESTRATORS

## USE THE DATABASE

The V4 schema already has:
- `job_urls_v3` table - THIS IS YOUR QUEUE
- `sse_events` table - THIS IS YOUR EVENT STREAM
- `crawl_jobs_v3` table - THIS IS YOUR JOB STATE

## THE FLOW IS SIMPLE

1. User creates job â†’ URL goes in `job_urls_v3` with status 'pending'
2. Cron job calls `/api/v4/process-queue` which:
   - Gets pending URLs from database
   - Calls `/api/v4/crawl` to crawl them
   - Calls `/api/v4/process` to process results
   - Updates database
3. Stream reads from `sse_events` table

THAT'S IT. STOP MAKING IT COMPLICATED!
