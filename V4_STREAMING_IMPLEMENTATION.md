# V4 Streaming Orchestrator Implementation - Step 1 Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented Step 1 of the V4 Streaming Orchestrator Plan by modifying `/src/app/api/v4/jobs/[id]/stream/route.ts` to use p-queue for concurrency control and stream events individually as URLs are processed.

## Key Changes

### 1. Added p-queue Import
```typescript
import PQueue from 'p-queue'
```

### 2. Replaced Batch Processing with Individual URL Processing
- Removed batch collection logic and `Promise.allSettled` approach
- Created `processUrl` function that handles one URL at a time
- Used p-queue with concurrency limit of 10

### 3. Implemented Streaming Events
Each URL now emits events at every step:
- `url_started` - When URL processing begins
- `url_crawled` - When crawling completes successfully
- `urls_discovered` - When new URLs are found
- `sent_to_processing` - When content is sent for processing
- `progress` - Regular updates with queue status
- `url_failed` - When URL processing fails

### 4. Maintained Architecture Patterns
- ✅ Kept resumable-stream pattern with ReadableStream return type
- ✅ Preserved three-function serverless pattern
- ✅ Maintained connection/cleanup logic
- ✅ Used proper TypeScript types

### 5. Enhanced Queue Management
```typescript
const queue = new PQueue({ concurrency: MAX_CONCURRENT_CRAWLS })

// Add URLs to queue as discovered
queue.add(() => processUrl(newUrl, depth + 1))

// Monitor queue status
while (queue.size === 0 && queue.pending === 0) {
  // Check for completion
}
```

### 6. Event Structure Example
```typescript
// url_started event
{
  type: 'url_started',
  url: 'https://example.com/page',
  depth: 1,
  timestamp: '2025-06-14T22:30:00Z'
}

// progress event
{
  type: 'progress',
  processed: 5,
  discovered: 12,
  queued: 7,    // URLs waiting in queue
  pending: 3,   // URLs currently being processed
  timestamp: '2025-06-14T22:30:05Z'
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Visibility**: Frontend receives events as each URL is processed
2. **Better Progress Tracking**: Shows queue depth and pending operations
3. **Improved UX**: Users see activity immediately, not in batches
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to adjust concurrency limits
5. **Error Isolation**: Failed URLs don't affect the batch

## Testing

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Build process completes without errors
- ✅ Unit tests pass for orchestrator structure
- ✅ Event types validated

## Next Steps

Ready for Step 2: Update the frontend to handle the new streaming events and display real-time progress with queue visualization.
