# Critical Fixes Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive tests that verify all critical fixes implemented in the Docspasta V4 system. These tests were created to ensure the bugs identified have been properly fixed and won't regress.

## Test Coverage

### 1. SSE Resumable Stream Tests (`sse-resumable-stream.test.ts`)

Verifies the fix for using `resumable-stream` library instead of custom ReadableStream implementation.

**What it tests:**
- ✅ Async generator pattern with resumable-stream
- ✅ Proper Last-Event-ID header handling for stream resumption
- ✅ Client disconnection cleanup
- ✅ Redis error handling in streams
- ✅ Memory leak prevention on repeated connections

**Bug it prevents:** Custom ReadableStream implementations that don't handle resumption correctly.

### 2. User Isolation Tests (`user-isolation.test.ts`)

Verifies the security fix preventing users from accessing each other's data.

**What it tests:**
- ✅ Stream API enforces user ownership checks
- ✅ Status API prevents cross-user access
- ✅ Create API tags crawls with correct user ID
- ✅ Authentication is required for all operations
- ✅ Multi-tenant data isolation in Redis
- ✅ Event stream contamination prevention

**Bug it prevents:** Users being able to see or access other users' crawl data and progress.

### 3. Queue Architecture Tests (`queue-architecture.test.ts`)

Verifies the event-driven queue system without polling.

**What it tests:**
- ✅ Event-driven job processing using BRPOP
- ✅ Multiple job type routing (kickoff, crawl, batch)
- ✅ Job failure handling and error events
- ✅ Atomic crawl completion
- ✅ Memory management over many jobs
- ✅ Graceful shutdown with job completion

**Bug it prevents:** CPU-intensive polling loops and incomplete job processing.

### 4. Redis Connection Management Tests (`redis-connection-management.test.ts`)

Verifies proper Redis connection lifecycle management.

**What it tests:**
- ✅ Connection creation with correct configuration
- ✅ Retry strategy implementation
- ✅ Connection cleanup with quit/disconnect fallback
- ✅ No duplicate connections
- ✅ Concurrent connection handling
- ✅ Memory leak prevention
- ✅ Health check capabilities

**Bug it prevents:** Redis connection leaks and exhaustion of connection pools.

### 5. Full Integration Tests (`full-integration.test.ts`)

Verifies all fixes work together in realistic scenarios.

**What it tests:**
- ✅ Multi-user concurrent crawls with isolation
- ✅ Complete flow with resumable SSE streams
- ✅ Worker processing with event emission
- ✅ Disconnection and resumption scenarios
- ✅ Stress tests with rapid connections
- ✅ Error recovery from Redis failures
- ✅ Atomic operations under concurrency

**Bug it prevents:** System-wide failures when components interact.

## Running the Tests

### Run Individual Test Files
```bash
pnpm test src/tests/critical-fixes/sse-resumable-stream.test.ts
pnpm test src/tests/critical-fixes/user-isolation.test.ts
pnpm test src/tests/critical-fixes/queue-architecture.test.ts
pnpm test src/tests/critical-fixes/redis-connection-management.test.ts
pnpm test src/tests/critical-fixes/full-integration.test.ts
```

### Run All Critical Fix Tests
```bash
tsx src/tests/critical-fixes/run-all-tests.ts
```

### Run with Coverage
```bash
pnpm test:coverage src/tests/critical-fixes/
```

## Test Requirements

These tests require:
- Proper mock setup for Redis operations
- Mock authentication for user isolation tests
- Mock database operations
- Vitest environment configuration

## Expected Results

All tests should pass, indicating:
1. **SSE Implementation**: Using resumable-stream correctly
2. **Security**: Complete user data isolation
3. **Performance**: Event-driven architecture without polling
4. **Reliability**: No resource leaks or connection issues
5. **Integration**: All components work together properly

## Debugging Failed Tests

If tests fail:

1. **Check Redis mocks**: Ensure redis-mock is properly configured
2. **Verify environment**: Check `.env.test` has required variables
3. **Review logs**: Tests include detailed error messages
4. **Isolate failures**: Run individual tests to identify specific issues

## Continuous Integration

These tests should be part of CI/CD pipeline to prevent regression:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
- name: Run Critical Fix Tests
  run: |
    pnpm test:run src/tests/critical-fixes/
```

## Adding New Tests

When adding critical fixes:
1. Create a new test file in this directory
2. Follow the naming pattern: `{feature}-fix.test.ts`
3. Update `run-all-tests.ts` to include the new test
4. Document what bug the test prevents
5. Ensure comprehensive coverage of the fix
