# Documentation Crawler Test Plan

## Context
We need comprehensive test coverage for the documentation crawler to ensure reliability and performance.

## Current Test Status

### Passing Tests
- Basic crawling functionality
- URL validation and normalization
- Error handling for invalid URLs
- Basic content extraction
- Link discovery
- Depth limiting

### Failing Tests

1. Cache Usage Test
   - Issue: Request counting not working correctly
   - Fix: Review cache hit/miss logic and request tracking
   - Priority: High (foundational for other tests)

2. Concurrent Request Test
   - Issue: Rate limiting not enforced correctly
   - Fix: Queue configuration and delay handling
   - Priority: High (affects performance)

3. Duplicate Content Test
   - Issue: Content hash comparison not detecting duplicates
   - Fix: Improve hash generation and content normalization
   - Priority: Medium

4. Metadata Test
   - Issue: Hierarchy extraction not working
   - Fix: Title extraction and hierarchy building
   - Priority: Medium

5. Memory Management Test
   - Issue: Large crawls not handled efficiently
   - Fix: Resource cleanup and optimization
   - Priority: Low (complex but not blocking)

## Test Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- ✅ Basic crawling
- ✅ URL handling
- ✅ Link discovery
- ✅ Depth limiting

### Phase 2: Performance (Current)
1. Cache system
   - Request tracking
   - Cache invalidation
   - Hit/miss metrics

2. Concurrency
   - Rate limiting
   - Request queuing
   - Timeout handling

### Phase 3: Content Processing
1. Duplicate detection
   - Content hashing
   - Normalization
   - Comparison logic

2. Metadata extraction
   - Title parsing
   - Hierarchy building
   - Validation

### Phase 4: Resource Management
1. Memory usage
   - Resource cleanup
   - Memory tracking
   - Performance optimization

## Testing Guidelines
1. Always write tests before implementation
2. Focus on one issue at a time
3. Maintain comprehensive logging
4. Regular performance monitoring
