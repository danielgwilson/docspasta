# Documentation Crawler Architecture

## Context
We need a robust system for crawling documentation pages that can handle various formats, maintain performance, and provide reliable content processing.

## Decision
Implement a modular crawler system with the following key architectural decisions:

### 1. Core Architecture
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability
- Implement a queue-based processing system using p-queue
- Separate concerns into distinct modules (crawler, cache, content processing)

### 2. Content Processing
- Use JSDOM for HTML parsing to ensure reliable DOM manipulation
- Implement TurndownService for HTML to Markdown conversion
- Use content hashing for deduplication
- Extract metadata using DOM traversal

### 3. Caching Strategy
- Implement version-aware caching
- Use cache invalidation based on content changes
- Store processed results to minimize redundant processing

### 4. Testing Approach
- Use Vitest for test framework
- Implement MSW for API mocking
- Create custom test utilities for crawler validation
- Focus on test-driven development

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Strong type safety with TypeScript
2. Reliable HTML processing with JSDOM
3. Efficient queue management with p-queue
4. Flexible content processing pipeline
5. Comprehensive test coverage

### Negative
1. Additional complexity in cache management
2. Memory usage concerns for large crawls
3. Potential performance overhead from DOM parsing

## Implementation Notes

### Core Components
1. DocumentationCrawler
   - Handles URL processing and crawl management
   - Implements depth and concurrency controls
   - Manages the processing queue

2. Cache System
   - Handles result caching
   - Implements version control
   - Manages cache invalidation

3. Content Processor
   - Converts HTML to Markdown
   - Extracts metadata
   - Handles content deduplication
